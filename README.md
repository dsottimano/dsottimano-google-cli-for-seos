# Google cli for SEO professionals

## Reference

## What can it do?

### Program your own parameters.  In this example (;esp), we change gl,hl,lr to Spain/Spanish and use Madrid's uule to search for pizza.

### Use this in the omnibox. Warning, if you change the default operator from ; to /, Chrome will try to search your file system.

### Change country, language interface and results language in an instant.  ;g (country)(interface)(result_language), so in this example, ;g brfrde which means we're searching in Brazil, with a French language interface for German results.

### Quickly cycle between search types.  Here, we go from cat news to videos, to images and reset with the magic ;r parameter

### You can change the default operator.  Slash is nice, but can be a conflict for some searches as well as the omnibox.

### Search seo updates, in the news, with 100 results for the past 24 hours

### Easy shortcuts for fun stuff like your public IP address.

## Configuration

Just add to the configuration object (https://github.com/dsottimano/dsottimano-google-cli-for-seos/blob/main/main.js#L25)

**Basic query changing example**

Only search ebay.com and amazon.com with shortcut ;es


```js
{
  operator: "es",
  query: 'site:ebay.com OR site:amazon.com ',
  param: null,
  info: "limits results to ebay and amazon",
  fn: null,
  fnTakesInput: false
}

```

**Basic parameter manipulation**   

Here we'll create a command with operator u to return 100 results and remove the dupe filter.

```js
{
  operator: "u",
  query: null,
  param: '&num=10&filter=0',
  info: "set result number to 100 and sets filter to 0",
  fn: null,
  fnTakesInput: false
},

```

**Basic function input example**

Function inputs are when use a command and the following string separated by a space will be used in that function. Note, if you are using a function that needs to take input, you must set fnTakesInput to true.  

```js
{
  operator: "s",
  query: null,
  param: null,
  info: "shortcut for site: operator",
  fn: function(q) {
    return this.query = "site:" + q;

  },
  fnTakesInput: true
}
``` 
## Q & A

**Why isn't this on the extension marketplace?**

Not sure how stable this is with heavy usage so, I don't want to put out a bad product.  If in a few weeks, everything hold up and Google doesn't break this, then I'll put up a nicer version with a GUI for config

**Are you recording any of my data/keystrokes/etc?**

No way. Please check the code or have someone review the code, there is nothing of that sort in the code and will never be.

**Can you get blocked for using too many parameter searches?**

Not blocked, but you'll get a captcha if you hit this too hard.  For example, I had to exceed 30 queries in a minute for Google to block me with a captcha (temporarily of course)

**How does this work?**

Chrome's APIs allow blocking of a request URL.  When you request Google's search, I check to see if you want to change that query with a shortcut.

**After I change the parameters, they persist or the same parameters appear with the newest values, what's up?**

No different to how normal search functions with param manipulation.  If the same parameter appears twice, the last wins.  You can always clear by using ;r
